NOTE: From now onwards we will take input using OJ (Online Judge) snippet.

You will always get the input as a string. Suppose you have given the input like this:
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9

Then you need to convert it into actual 2D matrix first. Same as:
[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]

For doing this and handling multiple input in one shot we will use snippet.


For Matrix INPUT: First line contains two integers N and M, no of rows and columns of matrix.

Next N lines contains M space separated integers which are elements of matrix.
