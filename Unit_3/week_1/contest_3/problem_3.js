? People in Queue

You have to make a Queue of people of size K which can process two type of request:

Type 1: A person with identity X will enter the queue, if the person can enter the queue output the number X else output -1 in a new line.
Type 2: In this type of query you need to process the person who is at the front of queue, if no person is present in the queue output -1 else output the identity of the number.

The Queries will be of the form :
1X - Type 1 Query which means this person with identity X is trying to enter the queue
2 - Type 2 Query which means you need to process the person in front of the queue

A person cannot enter a queue if the queue is full, also the front person is removed after being processed (if any)
Note: Type 1 Query is followed by an integer X which denotes identity of the person. See Hint for better explanation.

*Input Format:
The First line of input will contain K, Q, denoting size of queue and the number of queries
The next Q lines will contain the Q queries.

*Constraints:
1 â‰¤= K,Q <= 10^5
1<= X <= 10^6

*Output Format:
For each query output the result in a new line.

Input:2 6
1 1
1 2
1 3
2
2
2

Output:1
2
-1
1
2
-1

*HINT:
K = 2, Q=6
Size of Queue = 2 and Queries = 6
Query 1: 1 1 which means person with identity 1 is trying to enter the Queue, also the size of queue is 2 and it has space left so we allow 1 to enter and output it's identity
Query 2: 1 2 which means person with identity 2 is trying to enter the Queue, it enters as well
Query 3: 1 3, which means person with identity 3 is trying to enter the queue but the queue is full , so we output -1

Now for Query of type 2 if something is present in front of queue then we process it and output it's identity, else we output -1
Query 4: 2, In front of queue we have 1, so it will be processed and removed from queue, so we output 1
Query 5: 2, In front of queue we have 2, so it will be processed and removed from queue, so we output 2
Query 6: 2, Queue is empty, so we cannot process anything then output will be -1
